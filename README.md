# Visualizing *Practical Path Guiding for Efficient Light-Transport Simulation* 

This project aims to visualize the important aspects of the *Practical Path Guiding for Efficient Light-Transport Simulation* paper by Thomas Müller, Markus Gross and Jan Novák. Specifically we have developed a demonstration of how the *adaptive spatial-directional tree* can be used to guide paths during rendering to areas of high radiance.
